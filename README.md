# NBALineupAnalyses
Personal project to analyze the performance of various NBA teams' lineups and players' Adjusted Plus-Minus

**This is a work in progress.**

Data is collected from basketballreference using BeautifulSoup to scrape play-by-play information. Scoring and substitution events are processed and attributed to the active lineup, and using this aggregated data, we can get a very general view of how the team in question's lineups are performing.

Deeper dive ideas to be implemented include repeating this process league-wide to calculate the strength of opposing lineups for a more accurate representation of lineup performances as well as calculating players' adjusted plus-minus.
